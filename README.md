An AI-powered lead generation and outreach platform for DuPont Tedlar's Graphics & Signage team. The system automates finding and qualifying sales leads by researching industry events and trade associations where potential customers might be present.


Built by [Nicole Hao](https://nicolehao34.github.io/) with **scalability** and **generalizability** in mind. 


Ready to be adapted to different product teams at DuPont Tedlar. ‚ú®

## Updates
WELCOME TO THE DEMO BRANCH. 

**May 15, 2025 Update - I have no LinkedIn API Key >:(** 
I REMOVED ALL LINKEDIN SERVICES HERE SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LINKEDIN API KEY, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN THE DEMO ITSELF. There's some residue of my attempts at linkedin sales navigator integration in the dev branch. I'll keep working on it!

**May 15, 2025 Update**: I used replit to help with fast deployment. [Check it out!](https://genlead-ai-nicolehao7.replit.app/)

## Future Work
There are so many more features I would like to fully implement if I had more time. Here's a few that I will keep working on:

### Allowing multiple selections on target events page

Right now, you can only select one target event because it's a prototype. In the future, the end-user will be able to select multiple events.

### Adding Lead Genneration Progress Bar/Animation
Need to add either (1) a Progress bar that will show the lead generation status or (2) a generating leads animation after clicking on the generate leads button.

### Exporting leads and uploading them to CRM platforms
As title. The backend for this is not implemented yet. But would help with Dupont Tedlar's workflow integration.

### Displaying Match Details with Sources
Each generated lead should have a tab on its page named match details that shows exactly which previously specified criteria the lead matched with, this can be done using the GPT-o4 model as well. 

Currently, if you click on the tab, it displays the following message:
No detailed match criteria available for this lead
This lead was generated with an earlier version of the system which didn't include detailed matching metrics.

### Enabling Linkedin Sales Navigator API
I have the backend and the frontend setup for this feature but I unfortunately don't have a linkedin API key.... So as a result the linkedin links you see in the demo are all invalid. In the main branch, I still kept most of the backend functionalities for linkedin services. If you are curious.

### Feedback Loop

I didn't get the time to implement this fully, but ideally, after contacting leads, the end-user should be able to update their status to improve future lead generation, to truly create a humna-in-the-loop ai agent experience. For example:

1. User should be able to navigate to the "Review Leads" step
2. Then Update lead statuses based on actual interactions
3. This feedback helps the AI improve future recommendations
